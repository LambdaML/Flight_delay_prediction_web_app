When try:
http://localhost:5000/airplanes/
http://localhost:5000/airplanes/?TailNum=&Owner=&OwnerState=&Manufacturer=BOEING&Model=&ManufacturerYear=&SerialNumber=&EngineManufacturer=&EngineModel=
see error:
1. elastic query not working properly with the sorting. When deleting sorting, it works.
2. Pagination not working still. When click next, no more records displayed.

Need to address later.
